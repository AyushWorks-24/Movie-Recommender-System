# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A simple and interactive **Movie Recommender System** built using Python. This project uses collaborative filtering or content-based filtering (depending on implementation) to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Recommend movies based on user input or selected titles
- 🎥 Display movie posters and details
- 🧠 Uses cosine similarity or a trained model to find similar movies
- 🖥️ Interactive web interface using Streamlit (optional enhancement)
- 💡 Jupyter notebook for analysis and experimentation

└── similarity.pkl                     # Precomputed similarity matrix (optional)
```

## 📦 Requirements

Install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Typical requirements include:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- streamlit (optional)
- requests
- ast

## 📊 Data Used

The recommender system uses a dataset containing movie titles, genres, tags, and optionally user ratings. You can use:

- [TMDB or IMDb datasets]
- Custom movie metadata CSV

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook "movie recommendor system.ipynb"
```

### (Optional) Run the Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧠 How it Works

- Input a movie title
- Compute similarity (using cosine similarity or a model)
- Return top N most similar movies
- Display movie titles (and posters if using TMDB API)
